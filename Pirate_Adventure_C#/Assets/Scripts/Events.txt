Have a nice trip... 


Nothing happens...
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
I wonder what's over the horizon?
Oh, the seagulls crap on the helm
I can't wait to get down on the ground...
Now to drink rum and enjoy a girl


Captain, on the course 
I see a bottle, maybe there's a map in it?


Finally, solid ground...
